# Gabrielle Alexa Noel • she/her 🦋
I'm a software developer working with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, Spring Boot, React, Angular, vanilla JS, HTML, CSS. 

Otherwise, I have a background in writing/reporting and digital content management. My reporting has focused a lot on dating, relationships, sexuality, and non-monogamy. My first book, titled "<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-live-with-the-internet-and-not-let-it-run-your-life-gabrielle-alexa-noel/1137428227">How To Live With The Internet And Not Let It Run Your Life</a>" (Smith Street Books), is out now & available at most places where books are sold.

Currently: a software engineer at <a href="https://www.smoothstack.com/">Smoothstack</a> and doing React development for <a href="https://hashtagopen.com/">#Open</a>.

I'm a software developer working with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, Spring Boot, React, Angular, and vanilla JS. Otherwise, I have a background in writing, digital content management, and storytelling. My first book, titled "<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-live-with-the-internet-and-not-let-it-run-your-life-gabrielle-alexa-noel/1137428227">How To Live With The Internet And Not Let It Run Your Life</a>" (Smith Street Books), is out now & available at most places where books are sold.

Currently working as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.smoothstack.com/">Smoothstack</a> and doing React development for <a href="https://hashtagopen.com/">#Open</a>.

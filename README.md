I'm a software developer working with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Java, Spring Boot, React, Angular, and vanilla JS. Otherwise, I have a background in writing, digital content management, and storytelling. My first book, titled "How To Live With The Internet And Not Let It Run Your Life" (Smith Street Books), is out now & available at most places where books are sold.

Currently working as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.smoothstack.com/">Smoothstack</a> and doing React development for <a href="https://hashtagopen.com/">#Open</a>.
